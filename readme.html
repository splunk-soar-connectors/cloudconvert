      <li>
        <h3>Test Connectivity (Action Workflow Details)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> This action will test the connectivity of the Splunk SOAR server to the Cloud Convert instance by making an
            initial API call using the provided asset configuration parameters. </li>
          <li> The action validates the provided asset configuration parameters. Based on the API call response, the
            appropriate success and failure message will be displayed when the action gets executed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Get Valid Filetypes</h3>
        To retrieve information of valid input-output formats, the user can run this action.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Action Parameter</b>: Input filetype</li>
          This is a required parameter. The input filetype supports 200 filetypes. On selecting any one of the input format, the action generates a custom view listing valid output formats.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Convert File</h3>
        This action lets a user convert file for a valid input-output format.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Action Parameter: Vault ID</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>This parameter is the unique id for any file and it is a required parameter. In case if file content of more than one file is the same but has a different filename then the vault id will be the same for all those files.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Action Parameter: Filetype</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>This parameter is a required parameter and a dropdown box that lists all the output formats into which user wants their file to be converted.</li>

            <li>This parameter is an optional parameter and the user needs to provide a name along with an extension of the file which has been uploaded to the vault. In the case of different vault IDs of files, a user does not need to provide this parameter. If the vault id of more than one file is similar, then the user needs to provide the input filename of the file uploaded to the vault. In case the vault id is similar and the user does not provide the input filename, then the output generated file could be any of the similar vault ids.</li>
