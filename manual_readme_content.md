    -   Copy the generated API Key.
    -   NOTE: The API key generated will be shown only once. So store it safely.

-   Now, Log in to your Splunk SOAR instance.

      

    -   Navigate to the **Home** dropdown and select **Apps** .
    -   Search the Cloud Convert App from the search box.

        parameter.
    -   Mention the number of minutes to poll to convert a file. Default is 1 minute.
    -   Save the asset.
    -   Now, test the connectivity of the Splunk SOAR server to the Cloud Convert instance by
        clicking the **TEST CONNECTIVITY** button.

## Explanation of the Asset Configuration Parameters

The asset configuration parameters affect 'test connectivity' and some other actions of the
application. The parameters related to test connectivity action are API Key and Number of minutes to
poll for the converted file.

-   **API Key:** API Token for asset authorization.
-   **Number of minutes to poll for converted file:** The number of minutes the user wants to take
    to convert any file. The default time is one minute.

## Explanation of the Cloud Convert Actions' Parameters

-   ### Test Connectivity (Action Workflow Details)

    -   This action will test the connectivity of the Splunk SOAR server to the Cloud Convert
        instance by making an initial API call using the provided asset configuration parameters.
    -   The action validates the provided asset configuration parameters. Based on the API call
        response, the appropriate success and failure message will be displayed when the action gets
        executed.

-   ### Get Valid Filetypes

    To retrieve information of valid input-output formats, the user can run this action.

    -   **Action Parameter** : Input filetype

          
        This is a required parameter. The input filetype supports 200 filetypes. On selecting any
        one of the input format, the action generates a custom view listing valid output formats.

-   ### Convert File

    This action lets a user convert file for a valid input-output format.

    -   **Action Parameter: Vault ID**

          

        -   This parameter is the unique id for any file and it is a required parameter. In case if
            file content of more than one file is the same but has a different filename then the
            vault ID will be the same for all those files.

    -   **Action Parameter: Filetype**

          

        -   This parameter is a required parameter and a dropdown box that lists all the output
            formats into which user wants their file to be converted.

    -   **Action Parameter: Input filename**

          

        -   This parameter is an optional parameter and the user needs to provide a name along with
            an extension of the file which has been uploaded to the vault. In the case of different
            vault IDs of files, a user does not need to provide this parameter. If the vault ID of
            more than one file is similar, then the user needs to provide the input filename of the
            file uploaded to the vault. In case the vault ID is similar and the user does not
            provide the input filename, then the output generated file could be any of the similar
            vault IDs.
